I am a photographer, traveler, and an incoming Data Scientist. I am a Manchurian from Anshan, Northeast China. I also lived in Shanghai, New York, and Berlin before. Currently I am living in Baltimore. 

I am a first-year ScM Biostatistics student at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. I graduated from New York University with a bachelor in Social Science (Sociology) and a Bachelor in Data Science (Finance) in Spring 2023.
