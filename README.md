# Project1_Ziying

This is the project from Ziying Yang, a first year ScM Biostatistics student at JHU Bloomberg school of public health. In my personal website, you can know more about me, and also my current interest: the measles vaccination coverage problem. This website was created in Quarto and deployed on Quarto Pub
